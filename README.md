### Technologies

#### [Express](https://expressjs.com/)
Express is a minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features for web and mobile applications. 
It is responsible for serving the server

#### [Express-GraphQL](https://graphql.org/graphql-js/running-an-express-graphql-server/)
Express-GraphQL is the simplest way to run a GraphQL API server is to use Express, a popular web application framework for Node.js. 
It is responsible for connecting expressjs and graphql
 
#### [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/)
GraphQL is a query language for APIs and a runtime for fulfilling those queries with your existing data. GraphQL provides a complete and understandable description of the data in your API, gives clients the power to ask for exactly what they need and nothing more. 
It is responsible for defining the graphQL query schemas and providing the GrapphQL schema types
